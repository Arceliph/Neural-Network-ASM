This is a MASM x86-64 final project that I did for Computer Architecture.

This ASM fil should be put into a standard C project in Visual Studio and added as a source file.

Currently it is able to:
  ~ Generate a random dataset
  ~ Perform the exponential function
  ~ Use a training loop
  ~ Fit a single neuron to linear function y=mx+b

Later on I may add support for vector and tensors.
